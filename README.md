Try Writing a Story
===================

Now that you understand the basics of git and GitHub.
Let's use git for what it was built for. **Collaboration!**

To keep the barrier of entry low, we set up a basic story for you to elaborate on.


### Getting started

1. Fork this repository

2. Clone your fork

    ```bash
    $ https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/try-writing-a-story.git
    ```

3. Open **story.md** and elaborate on the story

4. Push to your fork and open a pull request

5. Pull from upstream and repeat

Pro-tip: You can use [this project][grip] to render GitHub markdown locally before committing.


### Guidelines

- Try to add something more often than change something
- Explore and use [the issues][issues] to coordinate
- Play nice and have fun!
